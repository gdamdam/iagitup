# iagitup.py - v1.1 - archive a github repository on archive.org

A small tool to archive a GitHub repository on the Internet Archive.
The script downloads the GitHub repository, creates a [git bundle](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle) and uploads it on archive.org
The upload is enriched with metadata from the github api and the README.md

## Install

Prerequisites (with debian or ubuntu):

    apt update 
    apt install python python-dev python-virtualenv libffi-dev libssl-dev git

Clone the repo and create the virtualenv and all things...

    git clone https://github.com/gdamdam/iagitup.git ; cd iagitup

create the virtualenv:

    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

install the requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

If you don't already have an Internet Archive account, [register for one](https://archive.org/account/login.createaccount.php) to give the script upload privileges.

Configure internetarchive with your Internet Archive account:

        ia configure


## Usage

        ./iagitup.py [-h] --githuburl/-u <github_repo_url>

you can add also custom metadata:

        ./iagitup.py [-h] --githuburl/-u <github_repo_url> --metadata=<key:value,key2:val2>

as example:

        ./iagitup.py -u https://github.com/<GITHUBUSER>/<RESPOSITORY>

The script downloads the git repo from github, creates a git bundle and uploads it on the Internet Archive.

The repo will be archived in an item at url containing the repository name and the date of the last push, something like:

    https://archive.org/details/github.com-<GITHUBUSER>-<RESPOSITORY>_-_<DATE-LAST-PUSH>

The git repo bundle will be available at url:

    https://archive.org/download/github-<GITHUBUSER>-<RESPOSITORY>_-_<DATE-LAST-PUSH>/<BUNDLENAME>.bundle

## Restore an archived github repository

Download the bundle file, form the archived item:

    https://archive.org/download/.../<ARCHIVED_REPO>.bundle
Just download the _.bundle_ file and run:

     git clone file.bundle -b master
